Bgolearn - Bayesian Global Optimization Learning Package

A comprehensive machine learning framework for materials design and optimization
using Bayesian optimization principles. This package provides tools for both
regression and classification tasks with various machine learning models.

Key Features:
- Bayesian global optimization for materials design
- Support for regression and classification tasks
- Multiple machine learning models (Gaussian Process, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
- Cross-validation and model evaluation capabilities
- Automated hyperparameter optimization
- Uncertainty quantification
